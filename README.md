* Bank Customer Analysis using Python

Bank Customer Analysis, where we explore, clean, and analyze bank-related data using Python's most powerful data science libraries. 

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to: Devlop a basic underastanding of risk analysis in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

Load and inspect a banking dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Identify patterns and relationships within the data

Visualize insights using matplotlib and seaborn

Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.12
Pandas â€“ Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy â€“ Numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook â€“ Interactive code environment


1.Loading and previewing the dataset
2.Checking for missing values and duplicates
3.Summary statistics and datatype checks
4.Grouping and aggregating data
5.Visualizations like:
6.Count plots
7.Distribution plots
8.Correlation heatmaps
9.Bar and pie charts

Final Insights
Based on the data analysis and visualizations, here are some key findings:

ðŸ”¹ Most customers fall in the middle-aged category, with a strong concentration around 30â€“40 years old.

ðŸ”¹ Married individuals form the majority of the bankâ€™s customer base.

ðŸ”¹ Customers with secondary education are the most common, followed by tertiary.

ðŸ”¹ Loans are more common among married individuals, and housing loans are more prevalent than personal loans.

ðŸ”¹ The number of calls made during the campaign has a positive relation with the success of subscription to term deposits.

ðŸ”¹ Customers contacted in the months of May and August dominate the dataset, likely indicating seasonal marketing campaigns.

ðŸ”¹ Most customers were contacted only once during the campaign, but multiple contacts often led to higher success rates.

ðŸ”¹ The variable poutcome (previous campaign outcome) plays a significant role, especially where success was previously recorded.
